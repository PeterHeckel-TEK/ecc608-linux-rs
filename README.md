## ecc608-linux-swi-rs

This library implements various elliptic curve cryptographic functions used by
[Helium Blockchain](https://helium.com) using the Microchip ATECC608 family with
the single wire interface. This includes creating keys for ECC types, signing 
messages, and configuring and locking the chip down for production use.
